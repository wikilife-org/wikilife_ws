Meta API
========

The meta API allows access to nodes from wikilife's meta graph.
The graph is also available for  `download <http://admin.wikilife.org/static/output/wikilife_meta_45_20121221_172854.js.tar.gz>`_, so you can have fast, offline access to it.

Our metadata is organized into a tree, compossed of categories, loggables, porperties and value nodes.
Each value node has the information necessary to log an activity.
